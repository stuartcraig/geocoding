# geocoding

A suite of geocoding datasets and tools. Maintained by Stuart Craig. Did you learn something about the data that ought to be incorporated? Email me at [EMAIL].

## zip2county

The zip2county crosswalk is derived from the HUD data [LINK], which is provided quarterly from 2010Q1 and currently available through 2019Q4. 

Things to watch out for:
